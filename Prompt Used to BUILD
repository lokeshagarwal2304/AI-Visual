Build a complete full-stack MERN project named "AI Visuals Hub". The application should be split into two directories: /client for the frontend (React + Tailwind CSS) and /server for the backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB). This app allows users to input text prompts and generate AI visuals.

üîç Core Features:
Prompt-to-Image Generator: Users can input text and get an AI-generated image (use a mock API or real service like DALL¬∑E if available).

Image Gallery: Display generated images in a responsive card grid with the prompt text.

Save Image: Allow users to save favorite visuals to a collection.

Delete Image: Enable users to remove saved visuals.

Virtual AI Chatbot: Add a simple chatbot (bottom-right floating chat bubble) that helps users generate better prompts, explains AI visual tools, or answers FAQs. It can use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT or a basic rule-based response system.

User-friendly Notifications: Use toasts/snackbars for success/error prompts.

Search Bar: Allow users to filter images by keywords/prompts.

üé® Styling Requirements:
Use Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive design.

Add dark/light mode toggle.

Use glassmorphism or neumorphism effect cards for images.

Animate components using Framer Motion for smooth transitions.

Display prompts using nice typography (e.g., font-serif, text-xl).

Use a fixed-width layout with grid/flex responsiveness.

Chatbot should have a soft animated UI with typing indicator and emoji support.

üõ†Ô∏è Backend API Endpoints:
POST /api/generate: Generate an image from a prompt (use mock or actual AI API)

POST /api/save: Save image info (URL, prompt, timestamp)

GET /api/images: Fetch all saved images

DELETE /api/image/:id: Delete specific image by ID

üß† Database Schema (MongoDB with Mongoose):
Prompt: String

Image URL: String

CreatedAt: Date

User (optional): For multi-user support

The project must be responsive on all devices, modularly coded, and well-documented for future scaling. Optional: Add authentication later using JWT for personal image collections.

Notes:The whole prompt is written by @lokeshagarwal2304,with a mutual support of @gayatri192005,(without any specifying bots and gpts).
